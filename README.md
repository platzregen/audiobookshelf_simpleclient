## Known Issues and Solutions

I have designed this primarily for M4B audiobooks as that's what I possess. Thus, support for audiobooks spanning multiple files may not function correctly. I have intentionally focused on M4B files that contain the entire audiobook and are well-tagged, including chapter information.
